# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors

## 🎮 Overview

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. The player competes against the computer — first to 3 points wins the game!

I also created custom pixel art for the Rock, Paper, and Scissors using [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/).
